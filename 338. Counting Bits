Problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/

*************************

Explanation :

1. We start by initializing an array countBits to store the count of 1's for numbers from 0 to n.

2. We also initialize an offset variable to help us keep track of the most significant bit.

3. We iterate through numbers from 1 to n.

4. For each number i, we check if i is a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). If it is, we update the offset to be the new power of 2. The offset helps us reference the correct index in the countBits array.

5. We calculate the count of 1's for the current number i using the dynamic programming principle. We add 1 to the count of 1's for the smaller number i - offset.

6. We store the count of 1's for the current number i in the countBits array.

7. We repeat this process for all numbers from 1 to n.

Solution : 

class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int[] dp=new int[n+1];
        int offset=1;
        for(int i = 1; i <=n; i++){
            if(i==offset*2) offset*=2;
            dp[i]=dp[i-offset]+1;
        }

        return dp;
    }
}
