Problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/

****************************

Explanation :

1. Find the Maximum Number of Candies:
Initialize a variable maxCandies to store the maximum number of candies.
Iterate through the array of candies, and for each kid's candies, update maxCandies if the current number is greater than the current maximum.
At the end of this loop, maxCandies will hold the maximum number of candies among all kids.

2. Check if Each Kid Can Have the Greatest or Equal Number of Candies:
Iterate through the array of candies again.
For each kid, check if adding the extraCandies to their current candies makes them have a number of candies greater than or equal to maxCandies.
If yes, add true to the result list; otherwise, add false.

Solution :

class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int maxCandies = 0;

        // Find the maximum number of candies
        for (int candy : candies) {
            maxCandies = Math.max(maxCandies, candy);
        }

        // Check if each kid can have the greatest or equal number of candies
        for (int candy : candies) {
            result.add(candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
