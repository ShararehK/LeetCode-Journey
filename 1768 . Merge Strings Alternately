Problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/

Description : 

1. Initialize an empty string result to store the merged result.
2. Find the minimum length between word1 and word2.
3. Initialize an index j to keep track of characters from word2.
4. Loop through the common characters of both words up to the minimum length.
5. Append the i-th character from word1 and the j-th character from word2 to the result.
6. Increment the index j to move to the next character in word2.
7. Check if the two input strings are of the same length. If they are, return the result.
8. If word1 is longer, append the remaining characters from word1 to the result.
9. If word2 is longer, append the remaining characters from word2 to the result.
10. Return the final merged result.


Solution : 

class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        String result="";
        int len=Math.min(word1.length(),word2.length());
        int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
            result+=word1.charAt(i);
            result+=word2.charAt(j);
            j++;
            
        }
        if(word1.length()==word2.length()){
            return result;
        }
        else if(len<word1.length()){
            return result+=word1.substring(len);
        }
        else if (len<word2.length()){
            return result+=word2.substring(len);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
