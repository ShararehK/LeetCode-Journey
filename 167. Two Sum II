**********************

Explanation :

1. Initialize Variables:
result: An array of size 2 to store the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
start: An index pointing to the beginning of the array (numbers).
end: An index pointing to the end of the array (numbers).

2. While Loop:
The loop continues until the sum of the numbers at the start and end indices equals the target.
If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the end index.
If the sum is less than the target, increment the start index.

3. Calculate Result Indices:
After exiting the loop (when the sum is equal to the target), set result[0] to start + 1 and result[1] to end + 1. The +1 is used because indices in arrays are 0-based, but the problem likely expects a 1-based index.

4. Return Result:
The result array now contains the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target, and it is returned.

Solution :

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int [] result=new int [2];
        int start =0;
        int end =numbers.length-1;
        while (numbers[start]+numbers[end]!=target){
            if (numbers[start]+numbers[end]>target){
                end --;
            }
            else if (numbers[start]+numbers[end]<target){
                start++;
            }
        }
        result[0]=start+1;
        result[1]=end+1;
        return result;
    }
}
